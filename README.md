# gpuhydro
To foster GPU computing, we show sample codes of hydrodynamic simulations in this repositry.

## Fortran witn OpenACC

### 2D Kelvin-Helmholtz Instability
The code for GPU computaiton is prepared in [./KHf90openacc/](KHf90openacc). To compare the performance with its CPU version, we have also prepared  openmp version in [./KHf90openmp/](KHf90openmp).
